Performance Issues and Bugs:
  ☐ test duplicated test steps
    ☐ test with different titles

  ☐ some items can exceed map size

UI/UX:
  ✔ use a react state to keep track of items @done(20-05-13 00:26)
    ☐ create 2 react classes (full & mini) @critical
      - mini is fork of full with /10 size and no details or text or any interactions
      ☐ use a array.map to render them in both maps
    
  ☐ searching for tests using their titles for actions @low
    - scrolls to the first result but highlight all results in both maps

  ☐ turn the app to electron @low 
    - saving additional data about the gui state in disk
      - can be saved inside map file for now
    - loading the map file automatically at the start
    - rendering screenshots of tests (normally the app won't have permission to read them from disk) 
    - running tests inside the gui using core
