Performance Issues and Bugs:
  ☐ research changing might-core map to be familized and get rid of the duplicate issues

  ☐ test duplicated test steps (same test, same title twice in map.json)
    ☐ test with different titles (same test, different titles)

  ☐ some items can exceed map size

  ☐ improve svg loading times by detaching react-svg

UI/UX:
  ☐ allow click and drag function in minimap

  ☐ improve the dialogue UX
    - enter to apply
    - better UI to the focused input box
    - redesign the delete dialogue

  ✔ deleting test steps
    ☐ hovering over an action should highlight which items are going to be deleted

    ☐ saving additional data about the gui state in disk (can be saved inside map file for now)
      ☐ load last scroll position

  ☐ searching for tests using their titles for actions @low
    - scrolls to the first result but highlight all results in both maps

General:
  ☐ turn the app to electron @low
    - file system access
      ☐ loading the map file automatically at the start
      ☐ rendering screenshots of tests
    - nodejs access
      ☐ running tests inside the gui using core (leveraging on electron's main process)
