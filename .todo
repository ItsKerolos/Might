Performance Issues and Bugs:
  ☐ test duplicated test steps (same test, same title twice in map.json)
    ☐ test with different titles (same test, different titles)

  ☐ some items can exceed map size

UI/UX:
  ☐ add icons to context menu
  
  ☐ undo button
  ☐ redo button

  Management:
    ✔ deleting test steps @done(20-06-24 23:09)
      ☐ hovering over an action should highlight which items are going to be deleted

  ☐ searching for tests using their titles for actions @low
    - scrolls to the first result but highlight all results in both maps

  ☐ saving additional data about the gui state in disk (can be saved inside map file for now)
    ☐ load last scroll position

  ☐ turn the app to electron @low 
    - file system access
      ☐ loading the map file automatically at the start
      ☐ rendering screenshots of tests
    - nodejs access
      ☐ running tests inside the gui using core (leveraging on electron's main process)
