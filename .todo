Performance Issues and Bugs:
  ☐ test duplicated test steps (same test, same title twice in map.json)
    ☐ test with different titles (same test, different titles)

  ☐ some items can exceed map size

UI/UX:
  ☐ undo button
  ☐ redo button

  Management:
    ✔ deleting test steps @done(20-06-24 23:09)
      ☐ hovering over an action should highlight which items are going to be deleted

    ☐ edit test titles

  ☐ searching for tests using their titles for actions @low
    - scrolls to the first result but highlight all results in both maps

  ☐ turn the app to electron @low 
    - saving additional data about the gui state in disk
      - can be saved inside map file for now
    - loading the map file automatically at the start
    - rendering screenshots of tests (normally the app won't have permission to read them from disk) 
    - running tests inside the gui using core
