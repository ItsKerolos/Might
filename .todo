Performance Issues and Bugs:
  ☐ test duplicated test steps (same test, same title twice in map.json)
    ☐ test with different titles (same test, different titles)

  ☐ some items can exceed map size

UI/UX:
  - improve the dialogue UX
    ☐ better UI to the focused input box

  ☐ searching for tests using their titles for actions @low
    - scrolls to the first result but highlight all results in both maps

General:
  - file system access
    - loading the map file automatically at the start
      (not available using the native filesystem api yet,
      but might happen in the feature since a lot of apps how need access to files
      also need a similar feature like IDEs)
