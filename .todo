Performance Issues and Bugs:

UI/UX:
  ☐ drawing items:
    ☐ figure out the structure of children @critical 
      ☐ drawing lines connecting children to parent

    ☐ create 2 react classes (full & mini)
      - mini is fork of full with /10 size and no details or text or any interactions
      
    ☐ use a react state to keep track of items
      - use a array.map to render them in both maps

  ☐ searching for tests using their titles for actions
    - scrolls to the first result but highlight all results in both maps
