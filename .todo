Performance Issues and Bugs:

UI/UX:
  ☐ drawing items:
    ☐ create 2 react classes (full & mini)
      - mini is fork of full with /10 size and no details or text or any interactions
      
    ☐ use a react state to keep track of items
      - use a array.map to show them for both maps full and mini

    ☐ figure out the structure of children
      ☐ drawing lines connecting children to parent
