Performance Issues and Bugs:
  ☐ Further simplify and optimize the mindmap/minimap code @critical

  ☐ test duplicated test steps (same test, same title twice in map.json)
    ☐ test with different titles (same test, different titles)

  ☐ some items can exceed map size

UI/UX:
  Management:
    ☐ adding new test steps
    ☐ deleting test steps
    ☐ editing test steps

  ☐ searching for tests using their titles for actions @low
    - scrolls to the first result but highlight all results in both maps

  ☐ turn the app to electron @low 
    - saving additional data about the gui state in disk
      - can be saved inside map file for now
    - loading the map file automatically at the start
    - rendering screenshots of tests (normally the app won't have permission to read them from disk) 
    - running tests inside the gui using core
