Performance Issues and Bugs:
  ☐ research changing might-core map to be familized and get rid of the duplicate issues

  ☐ test duplicated test steps (same test, same title twice in map.json)
    ☐ test with different titles (same test, different titles)

  ☐ some items can exceed map size

  ☐ marking what steps are tests are what are not is a huge mess to handle

UI/UX:
  ☐ improve the dialogue UX
    ✔ enter to apply
    ☐ better UI to the focused input box
    ☐ redesign the delete dialogue

  ✔ deleting test steps
    ☐ hovering over an action should highlight which items are going to be deleted

  ☐ saving additional data about the gui state in disk (can be saved inside map file for now) @low
    ☐ load last scroll position

  ☐ searching for tests using their titles for actions @low
    - scrolls to the first result but highlight all results in both maps

General:
  - file system access
  ☐ rendering screenshots of tests (needs a directory handle of the project)
  - loading the map file automatically at the start
    (not available using the native filesystem api yet,
    but might happen in the feature since a lot of apps how need access to files
    also need a similar feature like IDEs)
