Performance Issues and Bugs:
  ☐ items can exceed default map size @low

UI/UX:
  ☐ searching for tests using their titles for actions @low
    - scrolls to the first result but highlight all results in both maps

General:
  - file system access
    - loading the map file automatically at the start
      (not available using the native filesystem api yet,
      but might happen in the future, since a lot of apps that need access to files
      also need a similar feature like IDEs)
