Navigate to a different URL. 

This should NOT be used to navigate, users mostly navigate trough web apps with buttons and gestures, and those should be tested instead.

This should be used to give your app some parameters to enable mocks or skip some steps if you already tested the navigation buttons.

#### Examples

- **/about** - Goto a different page on the default URL.

- **https://google.com** - Goto a different site entirely.

- **back** - Go back in history.

- **forward** - Go forward in history.
