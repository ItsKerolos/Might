**This project is still in-development, it might be unstable.**

## The Problem

End-to-end testing can get very complicated and can be overwhelming; especially if you want to start testing a huge app, that would take a lot of time and afford, and will boring and repetitive.

## The Solution

A no-code (almost zero-config) method to perform end-to-end tests, handling most of the mess in the background.

Might GUI is an easy way to create and handle tests, it was designed to actually make the whole process easier and more enjoyable.

## Installation

Coming Soon

<!-- `
npm install --save-dev might-gui` -->

## Usage

- [might-cli](https://github.com/ItsKerolos/might-cli) if you need to run your tests without opening the GUI or you need to run your them inside a CD pipeline.
- [might-core](https://github.com/ItsKerolos/might-core) if you need to run tests programmatically or build a different tool.
