**This project is still in-development, it might be unstable.**

## The Problem

End-to-end testing can get very complicated and can be overwhelming; especially if you want to start testing a huge app, that would take a lot of time and afford, and will boring and repetitive.

## The Solution

A no-code (almost zero-config) method to perform end-to-end tests, handling most of the mess in the background.

Might is an easy way to create, manage and edit tests, it was designed to make the whole process easier and faster.

## Installation

#### IMPORTANT: This project depends on the experimental [Native File System API](https://web.dev/native-file-system/) which is currently only supported by Chrome 83+ and requires ```chrome://flags/#native-file-system-api``` to be enabled manually.

`npm install --save-dev might-ui`

## Usage

`npx might-ui`

After that it opens automatically in your browser, **(but to actually run the tests you need to install [might-cli](https://github.com/ItsKerolos/might-cli)).**
