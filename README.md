End-to-end testing can get very complicated and overwhelming; especially if you need to start testing huge apps, that would take a lot of time and afford, and will be boring and repetitive.

### The Solution

A no-code method to perform and manage end-to-end tests, handling all of the mess in the background.

[Might UI](https://github.com/ker0olos/Might) is an easy way to create, manage and edit tests,
and [Might CLI](https://github.com/ker0olos/might-cli) runs those tests.

### Installation

##### For the best possible experience with Might, please use a browser that supports the new [Native File System API](https://web.dev/native-file-system/);
##### Like Chrome 83+ with `chrome://flags/#native-file-system-api` enabled or [any other browser that supports the api](https://caniuse.com/#feat=native-filesystem-api).
##### However, Might will work regardless.

`npm install --save-dev might-cli might-ui`

### Usage
`npx might -m` or `npx might-ui`.

After that it opens automatically in your browser, **(to actually run the tests you need to use [might-cli](https://github.com/ker0olos/might-cli)).**
